# flashforge_print

Print over WiFi to a FlashForge printer.

I'm using it as an easy way to send the file to the printer after I slice with Cura.

# Support formats

Currently only printing raw gcode is supported, I didn't manage to use gpx to
convert it to x3g files. It only means you don't get a preview of what gets
printed on the screen.
